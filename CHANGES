    Release 1.3.0

    First release under DNS-OARC management with license changed to GPL v3.0,
    minor version jump to not conflict with forked repositories that
    increased the version themselves.

    Software now using Travis-CI and Jenkins to compile and test under Debian,
    Ubuntu, CentOS, FreeBSD and OpenBSD. Coverity Scan used for code analysis
    and 30 defects have been solved.

    Bug fixes / enhancements:
    - Big endian supported correctly
    - Check data length when processing TCP/UDP packets
    - Support VLAN-tagged packets
    - Support for older compilers (CentOS 6)
    - Prevent "time of check, time of use"
    - Use `snprintf()` instead of `sprinf()`
