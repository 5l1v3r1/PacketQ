pcapq is a command to run sql queries directly on pcap files.

The command also contain a very simplistic webserver in order 
to inspect pcap files remotely. 

Sample commandlines:

	packetq -s "select * from dns limit 10" sample.pcap
	    
	    Retrives the 10 first packets containing dns information from the file "sample.pcap"

	packetq -d -p8080 -w html/ -r pcap/

	    Starts a webserver on port 8080 (-p8080) as a daemon (-d) servering files from the 
	    directory html/ (-w html/) and pcapfiles from the directory pcap/ (-r pcap/).
