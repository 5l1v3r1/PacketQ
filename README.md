# PacketQ

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DNS-OARC/PacketQ.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/DNS-OARC/PacketQ)

`packetq` is a command line tool to run SQL queries directly on PCAP files,
the results can be outputted as JSON (default), formatted/compact CSV and XML.
It also contain a very simplistic web-server in order to inspect PCAP files
remotely.

More information is provided in our wiki on https://github.com/dotse/packetq/wiki

A short demo-video of PacketQ's capabilities is available on http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70wJmWZE9tY

## Dependencies

PacketQ requires a couple of libraries beside a normal C++ compiling
environment with Autoconf and Automake.

To install the dependencies under Debian/Ubuntu:
```
apt-get install -y libpcap-dev zlib1g-dev
```

To install the dependencies under CentOS (with EPEL enabled):
```
yum install -y libpcap-devel zlib-devel
```

## Usage example

Retrieves the 10 first packets containing DNS information from the file
`sample.pcap`:

```
packetq -s "select * from dns limit 10" sample.pcap
```

Starts a web-server on port 8080 (`-p8080`) as a daemon (`-d`) serving files
from the directory `html/` (`-w html/`) and PCAP files from the directory
`pcap/` (`-r pcap/`):

```
packetq -d -p8080 -w html/ -r pcap/
```
